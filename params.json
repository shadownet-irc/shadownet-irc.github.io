{"name":"ShadowNET","tagline":"Tomorrow's technology today","body":"ShadowNET was created initially so that the main administrator could better \r\nkeep tabs on the chat that his Minecraft server was running while he was AFK. \r\nIt has since grown into a globally accessible chat network with 90% uptime and \r\na fairly small, tight-knit group of friends talking about random things that \r\ncome up. It is also the test network of \r\n[elemental-ircd](http://github.com/lyska/elemental-ircd).\r\n\r\nWe run Atheme services and our own elemental-ircd daemon as well as are the\r\ntesting ground for [Cod extended services](http://github.com/lyska/cod) and \r\neventually its replacement [Eon](http://github.com/lyska/eon).\r\n\r\nThe main round robin is [`irc.yolo-swag.com`](irc://irc.yolo-swag.com) \r\nlistening on port `6667` and SSL port `6697`. Other ports may work but their \r\nuse is not recommended.\r\n\r\nWe feature `ChanServ`, `NickServ`, `BotServ`, `GameServ`, `HostServ`, SASL \r\nauthentication, and our own custom pesudoservice bot `ShadowNET` that will sit \r\nin your channel and expand youtube links among other things.\r\n\r\nWant to chat but don't want to crack out a full blown client? You can join our \r\nmain lobby `#niichan` through this handy \r\n[Webchat](http://sparkle.yolo-swag.com/webchat) link.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
